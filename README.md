Irritable bowel syndrome is a comorbidity of autistic spectrum condition. Parents of autistic children who report symptoms of IBS will get a referral to a gastroenterologist or a NHS dietician. They will then have to complete a food log table and a bowel movement chart and try to identify food triggers. This is problematic because:
*	The log and chart are paper based and so not shared between parents and nursery.
*	The parents and NHS staff visually identify triggers, and this is difficult as the dataset is multivariate.
*	Foods have composite ingredients which are obfuscated from the food log which means that the process of determining causation is difficult.
